================

My attempt at solving the Sling Blade Runner puzzle. This algorithm is very straightforward and runs to completion in a matter of minutes. ;)

As of Oct 5, 2014 my solution finds a chain of 217 movie titles.

Update on Oct 15, 2014: Longest chain is now 225 movie titles.

Update on Nov 21, 2014: Longest chain is now 240+ movie titles. I may need a heuristic to cut off the search early now as it continues finding many chains longer than 240 titles long. I'm going to try to run it overnight.
